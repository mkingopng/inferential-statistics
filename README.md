I beleive that one strategy that could be beneficial is to prepare one or two templates of solutions based on the problems contained in the course material. I think its unlikely that Tom will include anything radically different from that.

If we can relate the exam problems to a similar problem from the material, we can just change the parameters and calculate. Its the fastest and most accurate way where its possible.

Personally i will try to use R where possible. I'm not good at R but I think its good to learn it. I will also be using sympy to the problems that have to be solved algebraiclly. Again I'm not good at it but I think this is a good change to learn.

as always this is open. please share any suggestions you might have.
